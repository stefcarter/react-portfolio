      I am a lifelong computer enthusiast, so I'm studying web development at Penn State in pursuit of a career I can be passionate about. Coding is an enjoyable way to express my creativity. I'm also husband and a dad to two boys, and in my off time I enjoy hikes with my dog and expanding my tarantula collection.
